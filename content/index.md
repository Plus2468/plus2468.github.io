# Hello there new user and welcome to my website !
This website denotes known information about Touhou glitches and bugs.

### About
In this website I will explain what the bugs are, how they happen and why they happen. This site notes the bugs that happens in the shooter Touhou games made by ZUN. The bugs vary from a simple typo mistake to potential boss skips. A whole bunch of the bugs have been replicated and investigated. One thing that will not be covered (for now) are bugs that appear in the demo versions of the games, primarily because of the inaccessibility of most demos.

A bunch of bugs have been found by me but the majority is found by someone else. The websites I will be linking will often have an individual bug section respective per game. As such I will be linking to the bug pages of the game [game=7]Perfect Cherry Blossom[/game].

Although not listed, there are other sources which I get the information from. Those sources vary from YouTube videos, Twitter videos and Discord members discovering a bug themselves.

### LoDDK 2.3 update
This update changed following things:
- currently played mode on the extra stage is now displayed on the hud 
- changed loading screen and title screen
- added TLB to the minesweeper mode. How to unlock it? Let's just say you have to git gud at minesweeper.
- fixed ecl ins_706 to make TLB work, so make sure to actually use the executable included in this update

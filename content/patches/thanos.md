# Thanos patch

#### Wait what
This patch randomly makes the game ignore 50% of the ECL instructions (except some that are never ignored because game would break instantly if they were), hence the name. ~~Yes, the name was estabilished when that meme was still relevant~~. In other words, this randomly corrupts behaviour of enemies, and by extension bullet behavior. A wide variety of shenanigans can happen with this patch.

I don't have a specific video demonstrating the patch, but here is a stream VOD instead:

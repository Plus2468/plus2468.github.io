# Mystia's WBaWC Adventure
[img=content/patches/files/mystia_th17.png]  
A not-very-serious patch where Mystia goes on an adventure that makes no sense whatsoever. Only 20 days late for April Fools 2020, but made it for 4/20! Kind of sequel to the patch from last year, but I actually put effort into this one (the one last year was made in 8 hours or so). It's not necessary to play the previous patch first, as they are not really connected.  
  
Extra stage is ~~not finished~~ not started yet, and will be added in a future update.
  
This release also features a special DLC! Download the patch to actually find out what it is :^)

It's... actually not on thcrap, because it relies on ECLplus, and thcrap does not support per-patch plugins as of now. I tried to make installation of this patch as simple as possible, though!

# Custom shottypes
This is a complete list of all shottype modifications I made, in chronological order. Note that following mods only change the ingame shot and *do not* change dialogues or even
character selection sprites in the menu unless written otherwise.

### DDC Sanae
[yt]9eaOu_9jRPI[/yt]  
The first custom shottype I made. Aims to recreate the shottype from LoLK as well as possible. Do note that because the engine in DDC is a bit different, it's not a perfect recreation
(snake homing is imitated by infinite horizontal hitboxes, frogs fire faster).

### LoLK Sakuya
(no video)  
To be honest I don't really like this shot myself so I didn't even make a video. It's a weird shottype with kinda widespread unfocused shot, and homing focused shot.  
Sakuya also gets Reisen's bombs since she replaces her, so have fun bombing.

### HSiFS Sanae
[yt]\_UCND0HLcIw[/yt]  
Unlike the DDC one, this one is a perfect port of the LoLK shot (well, except for the bomb because they're hardcoded...)! Since she replaces Marisa, have fun blowing stuff up with Master Spark as Sanae!

### UFO Tsubakura
[yt]7QU8q16_s90[/yt]
A mod I made for the 5th Len'en anniversary! Unlike the other mods, this one changes menu, dialogues and endings too, making it a "full" mod. While the video only shows 1 shottype, the mod actually features 2 - TsubakuraA and TsubakuraB. The A shot is an imitation of the shot from the Len'en games, and the B shot is some jank I came up with.

(or through thcrap, it's there too!)

### The 0 power shot collection
(no video)  
Basically a collection of shottypes that stay at 0 power forever. Yep, that's it. Well, technically the power does increase, but the shottype doesn't get any better.  
Only available through thcrap, I didn't bother making another way of using the patch because who would want to play it anyway.

### The Imperishable Items
[yt]bBgeBhlMB_A[/yt]  
\.\.\.yeah it's technically a shottype mod. It makes the items freeze in place instead of being autocollected when you PoC.

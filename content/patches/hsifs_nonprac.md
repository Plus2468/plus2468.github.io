# HSiFS nonspell practice patch
[yt]LOixyVBB50g[/yt]  
It's basically a patch that replaces spells in spell practice with nonspells. It allows practising every nonspell in the game, except for Eternity's midboss non (if you *really* want to practise it, use spoilerAL midboss warp or something). Stage 4 midboss had to be moved to stage 5 spell practice because there are only 3 slots on stage 4, and as such it wasn't possible to put the non on st4.

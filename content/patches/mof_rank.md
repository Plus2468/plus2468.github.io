# MoF rank patch

A patch that adds insane rank to MoF. Because everyone *loves* bad ideas, right?  
  
Low rank:
[img=content/patches/files/mof_rank_min.png, hratio=75]  
  
High rank:
[img=content/patches/files/mof_rank_max.png, hratio=75]  
  
As you can see, it's quite a meme. The download below actually includes multiple patches:
- standard rank patch
- rank+, which is same as above except rank affects everything twice as much
- rank min, which is the standard patch except rank is locked to minimum
- rank max, where rank is locked to maximum
- ultra, where rank is locked above maximum
- ultra+, where rank is locked even higher above maximum
- ultra++, where rank is locked EVEN higher
- ultra+++, basically unplayable, probably impossible
- chaos, which works like the standard rank patch, except it uses a random rank value every time something is affected

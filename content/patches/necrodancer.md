# Crypt of the Necrodancer mods

These mods are a bit unusual, as they do not use game's built-in modding capabilities and instead modify the assembly code. They are only for the latest Windows version of the game (with DLC). You'll need [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php) to apply them (tested with version 7.1). Then, you'll be able to activate/disable them from the menu that looks like this:

**Activating any of the mods disables submitting to leaderboards until the game is restarted** (it will get stuck on "submitting scores, press [key] to skip" forever).  
  
Either way, currently there are the following things: 
## Marv - every character gets Marv (Mary's lamb). Spear not included.  
There's also an alternate version that removes enemies that Mary doesn't get (ghosts, harpies, blademasters).

## Tempo's curse - kill enemies to survive + enemy vision.  
Does NOT include infinite damage or the wacky enemy pool.

## Always electrify - makes every weapon electric.  
Electric dagger is double electric, and standing on the wire with the electric dagger should be triple electric..? (untested idk how it'll work lmao)

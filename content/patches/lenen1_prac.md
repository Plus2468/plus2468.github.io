# Len'en Evanescent Existence practice patch

[img=content/patches/files/lenen1_prac.png, hratio=78.6]  

Since Len'en has rather limited practice options, I decided to make this patch. It allows warping to any stage portion and pattern in the game, as well as setting power, flashbomb gauge and score. More information is in the `README.txt` file provided with the patch.

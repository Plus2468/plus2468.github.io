### Implemented news functionality
I figured it could be useful. I even made it so that it splits into multiple pages, you'll see that once there are more than 10 news entries here\.\.\. Though I guess you can see the navigation bar even now.  

Edit: 10 was a lot, so I changed it to 5.
  
LoDDK extra stage coming very soon!

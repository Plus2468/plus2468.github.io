### LoDDK 2.2 update
This update changed following things:
- added practice mode for the extra stage. Once you select a pattern, esc+r will restart it without having to choose it again. To select something else, you have to quit to the main menu and start the extra stage from there. Keep in mind that since it's using a bug to work, practice replays will desync.
- Hecatia now goes offscreen after spawning a moon in lunatic impact + taiko rocket. This was done because she would literally always block Raiko and prevent dealing damage to her.
- decreased screen shake intensity in Raiko's 4th spell because it was obnoxious
- fixed the amount of stars of the minesweeper boss
- mode selection now spawns actual text instead of retexturing stage logo
